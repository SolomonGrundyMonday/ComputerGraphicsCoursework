Jeff Colgan, Homework 3 README
CSCI 4229 Computer Graphics.

User inputs:

  "Escape" key:    exits the application.
  "0" key:         Resets the viewing angles for orthogonal projection.
  "m" key:         Switches to orthogonal projection.
  "f" key:         Switches to a side angle perspective from one of the corners (perspective projection).
  "o" key:         Switches to an overhead view of the scene (perspective projection).
  "d" key:         Switches to a side-angle view from the "front" of the scene (perspective projection).
  "r" key:         Switches to a first person view in the scene (perspective projection).
  Left arrow key:  Increases view angle azimuth by 5 degrees (orthogonal projection).
  Right arrow key: Decreases view angle azimuth by 5 degrees (orthogonal projection).
  Up arrow key:    Increases view angle elevation by 5 degrees (orthogonal projection).
  Down arrow key:  Decreases view angle elevation by 5 degrees (orthogonal projection).

Sources (code):
  I used the in-class example ex8 to learn how to generate 3D objects in GLUT.  In particular, the 
  functions for building a solid plane and cubes were particularly useful.  Cubes for learning how
  to make faces of polygons, scaling, translation, rotation, etc. and solid plane for learning how
  to use GL_TRIANGLE_FAN to make cones.  Additionally, I found the in-class example ex13 particularly
  helpful in learning to use perspective projection to give different eye positions.  Most of the 
  helper functions Print, ErrCheck, Fatal, etc. are completely unchanged from HW1 (and were borrowed
  from the in-class examples.

This assignment took about 10 hours to complete.
