The user controls for hw2 are as follows:

Keyboard inputs:

Escape key      -> Terminates the application.
Left Arrow key  -> Decrease the azimuth by 5 degrees.
Right Arrow key -> Increase the azimuth by 5 degrees.
Up Arrow key    -> Increase the elevation by 5 degrees.
Down Arrow key  -> Decrease the elevation by 5 degrees.
'0' key         -> Return to the default viewing position.
's' key         -> Switch to mode 1.  In mode 1, the sigma lorenz parameter is displayed and can be modified.
'b' key         -> Switch to mode 2.  In mode 2, the geometric factor lorenz parameter is displayed and can be modified.
'r' key         -> Switch to mode 3.  In mode 3, the Rayleigh Number lorenz parameter is dispalyed and can be modified.
'+' key         -> Increase the currently selected lorenz parameter (determined by mode variable).
'-' key         -> Decrease the currently selected lorenz parameter (determined by mode variable).
'd' key         -> Return all lorenz parameters to their default starting parameters (s = 10, b = 2.6666, r = 28). 

Notes on implementation:
  - I implemented the modification of the lorenz parameters to "wrap around" at specific values for each parameter.
    These "wrap around" values were selected by me when I was playing around with the lorenz attractor's parameter
    values.  I decided on these values because for each of the parameters, I noticed that the lorenz line trace
    sequence stopped doing interesting things at these values.  Below, I have listed the ranges that my implementation
    allows for each parameter, respectively.
  - Sigma Value: The sigma value can be modified to a value between a minimum of -250 and a maximum of 200.
  - Geometric Factor: The geometric factor can be modified between a minimum of -24.9973 and a maximum of 99.9902.
  - Rayleigh Number: The rayleigh number can be modified to a value between a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 90.
  - The minimum assignment states that one or more of the parameters in the lorenz equation should be modifyable,
    so I decided to make them all modifiable.  The user can change which lorenz parameter is displayed on screen
    and thus currently selected for modification by changing the mode (see the Keyboard Inputs section above).
  - This assignment took approximately 7 hours to complete.

Sources (code):

  For the utility functions (Print, ErrCheck, Fatal) and the special and reshape functions I used the ex6 program
  provided in the course materials as a reference.  I didn't really make any changes to these functions because
  my implementation did not require any modifications to the functionality provided by these functions.  I also used
  the display and key functions from the same example as a starting point, however here I made significant modifications 
  to allow the user to modify each of the parameters in the lorenz equation, and to draw the line trace of the values
  generated by the provided lorenz algorithm.
